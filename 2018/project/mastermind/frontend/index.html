        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The code maker makes a pattern of the pre-hand specified amount of code pegs.
            Duplicates are allowed in this game.
            The code breakers try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten (standard) turns.
            Whoever gets it in the fewest guesses, wins.
        <p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
            Once placed, the code maker program will provide feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the
            small holes of the row with the guess.
            A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both
            color and position.
            A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless
            they correspond to the same number of duplicate colours in the hidden code.
            For example,if the hidden code is red-red-black-black and the player guesses red-red-red-black,
            the code maker will award two colored key pegs for the two correct whites,
            no indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second black.
